# tmux short keys

Tmux helps me have multiple terminals at the same time, each is called a pane. 

|**Index**|**Short key** | **function**| 
| -- | --|  -- | 
|1 | ctrl + b + %| half the terminal vertically  |
|2 |ctrl + b + "| half the terminal horizontally  | 
|3 |ctrl + b + t| time  | 
|4 |ctrl + b + arrow keys| jumpying around  | 
|5 |ctrl + b + z| zoom in the terminal I am at  | 
|6 |ctrl + b + z| zoom out the terminal  | 
|7 |ctrl + b + c| create another pane where I can have multiple terminals|
